The GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive interface for the integration of the PmodA3 Digilent module, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), with an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). Central to the functionality of the module is its dependence on SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol. The design has been tested on Arty S7 board and timing constraints are all met.
